:::{#huan-heading}
Aspiring to be a physician-scientist, I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA in [The Geschwind lab](https://geschwindlab.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/pi).

I'm passionate about using systems genomics, computational biology and molecular neuroscience approaches to understand mechanisms in neurobiological and neuropsychiatric diseases.
